<h3>STARTING THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>We started by going through the website, understanding the structure and layouts. 
  We discussed about what parts of the website we should build and how Considering the time constraint and teams strengths, 
  we divided the work and were communicating from time to time to understand the work and to help each other. Effective communication between our 
  team was our strength to build this project effectively.</p>

<h3>CHALLENGES </h3>
<p>GIT-pull and push of the code ,using the platform was a very big challenge, still learning. Another challenge was to debug and merge the different codes into one. 
  As we learnt JavaScript recently, giving functionality to the website was a little difficult but the task was achieved eventually. 
  TAKEAWAYS We were able to achieve our goal because of the effective communication and understanding we had in our team. Understanding of the topics is important to 
  achieve what you want to build. We did our best according to the time constraints and will work on it to improve it further as we grow our skills in Masai School. 
  We will look forward to take challenges like this in future.</P>
